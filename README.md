# CALCULATOR
---
`HTML5` `CSS3` `Responsive design` `JavaScript ES6+` `Without libraries and frameworks`

---

- The goal was to create a calculator without using the built-in function eval(), thus avoiding eval()' sinherent high-security risks to users. 
- This task introduced JavaScript numeric precision issues and ways to solve them.
- The project goes beyond tutorial examples by its ability to calculate results only after the user pushes the equal button. This makes calculating the whole expression possible.
